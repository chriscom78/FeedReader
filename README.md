# Feed Reader Testing

## Project outline
Jasmine I was able to validate my code. 

The goal of this project was to write test spec in Jasmine.


## Run this application

Open index.html in your browser. 

Tests were coded in the feedreader.js file. 

The results will appears at the bottom of the index.html page.

Tests showing green are passed, red ones are failed.


## Tests I was asked to create:

1. tests to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.

2. loops through each feed and determines if the URL is defined and not empty.

3. loops through each feed and determines that each feed has a name and not empty.

4. ensures the menu element is hidden by default.

5. validates proper functioning of the hamburger menu toggle.

6. tests that there is at least one entry in feed.

7. tests that new content is loaded by loadFeed().
